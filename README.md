ELECTRON is a team of six secondary school students from London, competing in the F1 in Schools STEM Challenge. During the 2020/1 season, we had the honour of representing England at the World Finals, where we won the coveted McLaren Research and Development Award, and finished 6th internationally out of over 40 teams. 
F1 in Schools is an international STEM competition operating in 50 countries, where teams of students design and build a working model F1 car that is raced on a 25m track. Founded in 1999 by Andrew Denford of Denford Manufacturing as a way of fostering STEM education in a competitive and realistic environment, F1 in Schools quickly flourished into a vibrant, multidisciplinary tournament.
